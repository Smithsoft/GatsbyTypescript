When I’m using an app on my phone I don’t care what kind of app it is as long as I can do what I need. But if I want to have a mobile app built, suddenly there seems to be so many different choices to make.

## How do I know what kind of app I want?

This video builds on my previous one “How apps work”. If you haven’t watched that yet I suggest you go back and take a look.

This is the second video in my series on “How to build an app”.

In this video I’ll be looking at what goes into the three main different kinds of apps you can build for phones and tablets.

Let’s dive right in.

- The first kind of app is the native app.
  - These are harder to build, but
    provide full access to the power of the phone or tablet
- The second kind of app is the web app.
  - You know this as a website or online app.
- The third kind of app is a hybrid app.
  - These apps aim to be the best of both worlds:
    a native app that uses web functionality.
